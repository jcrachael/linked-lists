# About

A linked list is a linear collection of data nodes that point to the next node using a pointer. Each node holds a single element of data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is a head node and the last node in the list is a tail node and its pointer points to null. For example:

`[ NODE(head) -> ] [ NODE -> ] [ NODE -> ] [ NODE(tail) ->] [ null ]`

If the linked list is empty, the head node is a null reference.
